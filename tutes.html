	'Connected components of a network are subsets of nodes,<br /> where any node in the subset is reachable from every other node within the same subset.<br />The network below has two connected components encircled in blue.',
	'If we added a link between these two connected components,<br /> then we have one connected component, as shown below.',
	'We can also have 2-connected components where at least two nodes must be removed to make the component disconnected. In other words, every node within a 2-connected component has at least two distinct paths to every other node within the subset. 2-connected components are also 1-connected.  <br>This network has two 2-connected components, which are encircled in green.',
	'Let\'s consider the 2-connected component on the left.<br />All the nodes in the highlighted subset have at least two paths to every other node within this subset.',
	'Let\'s consider these two yellow nodes; they are connected by this path.',
	'They are also connected by this path.',
	'Similarly, if we consider these two yellow nodes; they are connected by at least two paths.',
	'Similarly, if we consider these two yellow nodes; they are connected by at least two paths.',
	'However these two nodes only have one path to each other and are not part of any 2-connected component.',
	'The Graph Thumbnail is a summary of the connectivity structure of a network.<br />These two images show different representations of the same network.<br />The one on the left is called a Graph Thumbnail.',
	'If we break down the Graph Thumbnail into its different components.<br />The blue (outermost) circle represents all the connected nodes of the network.',
	'The green circles represent the 2-connected components.<br />(the subset of nodes that have at least two distinct paths to every other node within the subset).<br />There are two 2-connected components in this network.',
	//'The dark orange circles represent the 3-connected components of a network.<br />(the subset of nodes that have at least three distinct paths to every other node within the subset).',
	'The orange circle represents the most connected component of this network.<br />(in this case, it is the subset of nodes that each have at least three neighbours within the same subset).',
	'The size of each circle is relative to the number of nodes within that component.<br />The more connected a component is, the warmer the colour of the circle is.',
	'Here is another example of a matrix representation of a network, alongside its respective node-link diagram.<br />In order to find the 1-connected components in a matrix, one needs to find cuts at the diagonal with no cells extending from one side to the other.',
	'If we consider nodes 2 and 1, then their overlap covers one coloured cell;<br />this means that nodes 2 and 1 belong to the same 1-connected component.',
	'Nodes 6 and 7 are not connected, hence their rows in the matrix do not overlap at any coloured cells.<br />Hence nodes 6 and 7 belong to two separate 1-connected components.',
	'Same applies for 11 and 12. Visible cuts at the diagonal hint a separate connected component, but one should check for overlapping cells away from the diagonal too.',
	
	'You will see these five visual representations throughout the study.',
